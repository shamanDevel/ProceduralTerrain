/**
 * This class uses George Marsaglia's XORShift algorithm to generate 
 * a sequence of pseudo-random numbers from a seed. The period of this sequence 
 * is 2^64 - 1, provided the numbers in the algorithm aren't changed. 0 is
 * not part of the sequence. The random numbers are of "medium quality" 
 * (not cryptographically secure).

 * Abstract: <em>Description of a class of simple, extremely fast random number 
 * generators (RNGs) with periods 2^k −1 for k = 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192. 
 * These RNGs seem to pass tests of randomness very well.</em>
